## Description
Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (mushroom, artichoke, anchovy), a size to order a pizza (s, m, l), and see the final cost. Here is the [repo](https://github.com/QuietEvolver/pizza-parlor-23.git)

### Objectives 
* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

## Tests

<!-- first function -->
Describe: Pizza()

Test: "It should return a Pizza object with two properties for toppings and size"
Code: 
const myPizza = new Pizza();
mypizza.toppings = ["anchovies", "pineapple"];
mypizza.size = "medium";
Expected Output: Pizza { toppings: ["anchovies", "pineapple"], size: "medium", price: 0}

<!-- new function -->

Describe: Pizza.prototype.cost

Test: "It should return a Pizza order toppings at $3 ea selection(s)."
Code: 
const myPizza = new Pizza();
myPizza.toppings = ["anchovies", "pineapple"];
myPizza.size = "medium";
myPizza.price = 6
Expected Output: PizzaÂ {toppings: Array(2), size: 'medium', price: 6}

<!-- new function 

Describe: Pizza.prototype.details

Test: "It should return toppings and size form selection(s)."
Code: const myPizza = new Pizza();
myPizza.toppings = ["anchovies", "pineapple"];
myPizza.size = "medium";
Expected Output: Pizza { toppings: ["pinneapple"], size: "medium" }

Test: "It should return a Pizza order toppings and size form selection(s)."
Code: const myPizza = new Pizza();
myPizza.toppings = ["anchovies", "pineapple"];
